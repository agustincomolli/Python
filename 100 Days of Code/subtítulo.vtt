WEBVTT

1
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.320
Well, we're going to dive in to this
study of Lectio Divina on prayer, and

2
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.040
we're gonna look at five easy steps to
prayer. And we're gonna see that prayer

3
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.960
is an invitation from God, that prayer
is an invitation into a divine dialogue

4
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.440
with God and into an encounter with
God. Pope Benedict XVI in his first

5
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.170
encyclical, he mentions that
Christianity is not simply a creed, but

6
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.630
rather an encounter with the living
God. And that encounter happens

7
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.150
especially in prayer. Indeed, the
Catechism of the Catholic Church talks

8
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.060
about prayer as that encounter with
God, that we're invited to an encounter

9
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.330
with God, we're invited to intimacy
with God. The challenge is most of us

10
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.790
don't feel like we encounter God very
often, or very deeply. Most of us long

11
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.280
for intimacy with God, but we haven't
found it yet. And there's this ancient

12
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.260
method in the Catholic tradition of
prayer, called lectio divina, and we're

13
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.610
going to talk about that method, which
sounds very sophisticated, and with an

14
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.210
ancient Latin title, but it's simply
Latin because that was the language of

15
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.250
the early church of the Roman Empire.
But that Latin title shouldn't throw us

16
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.300
off to this being a very difficult or
sophisticated form of prayer. It's

17
00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.070
actually quite simple. It means the
divine reading, that is praying with

18
00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.900
Scripture. And we're going to learn
what the tradition has to offer us in

19
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.950
the wisdom of the church on how to pray
with Scripture. And we'll see that

20
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.330
there's certain steps. And I think what
we'll find is that the challenges that

21
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.280
we oftentimes have in prayer is because
we don't know how to pray as we ought,

22
00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:59.190
as the disciples question, Jesus, Lord,
teach us to pray. In Luke 11, Lord,

23
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.910
teach us to pray. And St. Paul says, in
Romans 8, we don't know how to pray as

24
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.800
we ought. It's something that God has
to lead us and teach us in. And God

25
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.660
will teach each individual but the Lord
has taught the church in the wisdom and

26
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.340
tradition of the church, how to pray,
and our church is like a good mother.

27
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.030
And she wants to pass on this
tradition, this wisdom that the saints

28
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.650
have learned in their prayer time. And
in their perseverance in prayer, the

29
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.690
saints have learned simple methods for
praying well, and that tradition that's

30
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.600
been forged by monks and sisters in
convents, and monasteries, by saints,

31
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.020
and that method, those lessons are at
our fingertips if we just study this

32
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.030
tradition, and look into what the
church wants to give us in this great

33
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.940
tradition of prayer. So that's what I
want to dive into. But first, I want to

34
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.350
start with just the problem of prayer.
We all know as Christians that we ought

35
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.700
to pray, we know that it's one of those
fundamental Christian duties, I ought

36
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.880
to pray. However, we oftentimes see
this duty of prayer as an obligation

37
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.220
that is not engaging or enticing or
inspiring. We see it as, I know I ought

38
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.240
to floss.

39
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.670
I know it's good for my health. But I
don't want to do it, and I don't enjoy

40
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.360
doing it. And I'm very relieved when I
can check off the box. Yep, I flossed.

41
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.910
Got that done. And few of us enjoy
flossing. I think probably very few of

42
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:27.720
us, indeed.

43
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.810
And oftentimes, Christians encounter
prayer like flossing, something they

44
00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.180
know they ought to do, something that
they want to check off. It's good for

45
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.870
me to do. I'm glad I did it. But we're
relieved when it's done. And we're

46
00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.380
free.

47
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.390
And that's a shame because prayer
should be something that we deeply

48
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.920
desire to do that we find great
satisfaction, in that encounter of

49
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.640
prayer in that time of prayer. Prayer
should be something that feeds our

50
00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.330
soul, and our spirit, and strengthens
us for life. We should walk away from

51
00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.970
prayer empowered and encouraged, and
oftentimes inspired. And that's what

52
00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.170
God wants.

53
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.700
He wants us to leave that encounter,
like Moses left his encounter with God,

54
00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.330
with his face, aglow, and his heart,
aflame. That's what God wants for us in

55
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.670
prayer. And if we learn to pray, like
we should, if we learn the wisdom of

56
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:27.240
prayer,

57
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.030
we can have that encounter. We can have
prayer as something we long for and

58
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.190
desire. Prayer should be what that
beautiful bride in a Song of Song says

59
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.830
in chapter 3:1, I sought him who my
soul loves.

60
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.730
And then throughout the next few verses
of the Song of Songs in chapter 3:1-4,

61
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.430
she repeats this refrain, I sought him
whom my soul loves.

62
00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.910
Prayer is that seeking of God.

63
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.550
It's that search for God. But the
problem going back to this challenge

64
00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.950
that we face is, how do we pray? And
oftentimes, I think we have some false

65
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:14.000
ideas about prayer, or we take the
steps of prayer out of order, and it

66
00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.560
makes prayer much more difficult than
it ought to be. And that's what I want

67
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.860
to go through in this. This first
session is these challenges of prayer.

68
00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:25.160
The first thing about prayer that I
think is that, if we're honest, and I

69
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.380
know at least this is the great
temptation for me.

70
00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.020
As I look back, you know, when I really
wanted to start to pray, when I was 16,

71
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.530
I really encountered Christ at a
retreat. And I wanted to start to pray.

72
00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.040
And I had some great moments of prayer.
But then after that retreat experience,

73
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.150
and I went back to my everyday life, I
could pray at the retreat. But I

74
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.170
couldn't pray in my everyday life. I
didn't know how to pray. I didn't know

75
00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.860
where to begin.

76
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.680
And I had a search and try to struggle.
And so my spiritual life was on-again

77
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:58.250
off-again, when I would have youth
group once a week, and we would sing

78
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.040
praise and worship songs, and we'd
gather together, we would share

79
00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.510
petitionary prayers. I could pray there
with everybody. But then left to my own

80
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.520
devices, the next day, I didn't know
what to do.

81
00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.630
There wasn't, you know, the praise and
worship music, there wasn't the

82
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.730
fellowship of sharing intentions and
encouragement. I didn't know how to

83
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.860
pray. And so I'd fall off of prayer.
And that inconsistency in my prayer

84
00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:27.680
life as a teenager, was then reflected
in the inconsistency in my spiritual

85
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.240
life and in my moral life. And I would
have these great moments when I was on

86
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.010
retreat, or with my friends, who were
who were devout and wanted to follow

87
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.690
Christ, but then left alone. I didn't
know what to do. That becomes the

88
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.820
challenge. And I think the greatest
temptation to prayer, the greatest

89
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.460
threat to prayer is that we feel that
prayer, oftentimes, is dry and arid.

90
00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.680
And it's hard to be earnest about
prayer, if it's arid and dry.

91
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.250
It's hard to get excited, enthusiastic,
yeah, I want to spend that time,

92
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.910
because you could go to the experience
of going to a chapel, or praying in

93
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.440
your room. And I'd close my eyes and I
want to hear God speak to me. And I

94
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.450
wouldn't hear a voice. I wasn't a
mystic. I wasn't a saint. I wouldn't

95
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:19.680
hear a voice speak to me, it would be
silence. And I would share a few things

96
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:24.690
on my heart. Usually petitionary
prayer, very basic. God help me get

97
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:29.160
through this, help me with that, help
me with this test. Right.

98
00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.970
But it was, after I was done with my
petitions, I was pretty much spent in

99
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:41.760
my prayer. I had nothing left to say,
typically. And I had nothing to hear.

100
00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:46.140
And so what happened in my temptation
with prayer is my prayer became a

101
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.100
monologue. I would talk and God would
say nothing.

102
00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:56.850
And the the challenge or the problem
with that I realized later on in life,

103
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.560
as a young father of my son, Joseph,
when he was about four or five, he's a

104
00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.220
young boy. And we were tucking him into
bed one night. And as I was tucking him

105
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:09.630
in, we had had a wonderful dinner, we
had storytime, we had read bedtime

106
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:13.410
stories. And I was put tucking him in
with that little glass of water. That's

107
00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:17.640
about you know, 10% full of water.
Because as a wise parent, you know, not

108
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:21.990
to give them too much water at night,
before bedtime. And everything was done

109
00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.030
according to script. And as I was, you
know, saying good night, he's his

110
00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:31.950
little lip started quiver. And he
started to cry. I said what I could

111
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:36.840
what could possibly be wrong? I've been
with him for the last several hours of

112
00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.260
the day.

113
00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:43.230
What could possibly wrong like, Joseph,
what's wrong? And he says, to my shock,

114
00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:48.660
absolutely did not expect what he what
he said next, he said, God doesn't love

115
00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:48.960
me.

116
00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:56.370
God doesn't love me. Now, that hit me,
like a ton of bricks. I mean, that was

117
00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:00.900
that pierced my heart. My day job is to
teach people about God. Right? As a

118
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:05.400
scripture scholar and theologian, I
teach people about God and God is love.

119
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.850
And for him to think that God does not
love him, he doesn't have any idea who

120
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.660
God is.

121
00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.640
So of course, I did what any good
father would do. I launched into a

122
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:19.320
treatise of God's love and explain, Of
course, you're wrong. God loves you. He

123
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.660
loves you very much. Just like, I love
you know, now go to bed.

124
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:29.310
Now, after talking with my wife, I told
her what he said. And I said, I can't

125
00:09:29.310 --> 00:09:31.470
believe you know, he would say
something like this. This is this is

126
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:34.860
supposed to be teenage years, not age
four and five. This is goes against all

127
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.840
the parenting manuals, crisis of faith
at age four or five. Not fair. Right?

128
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:45.060
Not fair. But my wife had an idea that
I didn't have and this really comes out

129
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:52.470
of the feminine genius. She went in and
actually asked my son Joseph, why he

130
00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:56.880
thought God didn't love him. That
question never occurred to me. I just

131
00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.180
saw problem-solution. He thinks God
doesn't love him,

132
00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:03.690
I will tell him and teach him why God
loves him, and how much God loves him.

133
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.410
So she goes in with the feminine genius
says, Why do you think God doesn't love

134
00:10:07.410 --> 00:10:14.850
you? And then he explained. Well, you
know, we heard that story of God

135
00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:21.120
speaking to St. Francis of Assisi from
the San Damiano cross. And God spoke to

136
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:26.250
Francis. And then there's a story about
Jonah. And God spoke to Jonah.

137
00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:35.010
And what Joseph realized is, God had
never spoken to him. And so he looked

138
00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.940
at that little crucifix above his bed.
And he would close his eyes at night

139
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:40.860
and want Jesus to speak to him.

140
00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:43.260
And God never did.

141
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:50.040
And so what a child in his innocence
realizes is that if someone doesn't

142
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.030
speak to you,

143
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.730
they certainly couldn't love you.

144
00:10:56.070 --> 00:11:00.990
Now, as adults, we get more
sophisticated, we get more complex, and

145
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.880
we oftentimes lack the courage to face
the truth about reality face on. The

146
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:10.260
beauty of a child is a child is
ruthless in their honesty,

147
00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:12.760
in the way they look at reality.

148
00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.060
They're not,

149
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:20.700
you know, they haven't been corrupted,
yet. They look at reality full on. And

150
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:25.890
for that child, he realized, if God
doesn't speak to me, God must not love

151
00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:26.190
me.

152
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:34.860
God must not love me. Now, the
assumption is profound. If God does

153
00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.830
love me, he must speak to me.

154
00:11:39.610 --> 00:11:45.760
And that's the beautiful tradition of
Christianity. God does speak to us. God

155
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.620
does love us so much that He doesn't
just speak words to us. He speaks the

156
00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:59.110
word, Jesus, who becomes flesh. The
Word became flesh and dwelt among us.

157
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:03.190
God loves us so much that He speaks a
word that he hands over this Word to

158
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:09.520
us, in his son, and that word will
suffer and bleed and sweat and die for

159
00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.360
us. That's how much God wants to
communicate to us.

160
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.410
But the problem was, we're oftentimes
deaf to God's Word.

161
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:24.190
And so in a sense, God has to shout
from the cross, that he does love us,

162
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:29.380
that he does love us. Now what we had
to teach our son is that God does speak

163
00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:33.280
to us and God spoke in that powerful
way to St. Francis of Assisi from the

164
00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:38.980
cross. But that was unusual even for
St. Francis, God normally spoke to

165
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:46.780
Francis from his Word, the Scriptures.
Francis' rule, Francis' spirituality

166
00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:54.370
was fed from his daily encounter with
the Word. As Francis worked in the San

167
00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.560
Damiano church, rebuilding that church,

168
00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:03.190
his focus of his prayer life was
hearing the Word of God each day in the

169
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:07.270
Mass and reflecting on that Word as a
word spoken to him.

170
00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:12.340
And so the idea that Francis would sell
what he possesses, the idea that

171
00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.910
Francis would live with simplicity that
comes from his hearing the Sermon on

172
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.450
the Mount.

173
00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:23.170
So Jesus' normative way to speak to St.
Francis of Assisi was in His Word, and

174
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:26.830
the Sermon on the Mount, where he
teaches the 12 apostles as he sends

175
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:29.980
them out that they should go out in
twos, and they should take not an extra

176
00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:33.760
tunic. And Francis hears that word
himself and he looks around, he's got

177
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.840
three followers and says, okay, Jesus
sends us out in twos you two go out

178
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.150
this way to that village, and me and
the other one will go out to this

179
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.780
village.

180
00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:47.560
In other words, Jesus spoke to Francis
primarily through His Word through the

181
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.790
Scriptures. And this is the great
insight in the early Christian

182
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:57.760
tradition, such that St. Ambrose, that
great teacher of St. Augustine. St.

183
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:04.660
Ambrose said when you pick up the
scriptures, God speaks to you. When you

184
00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:10.840
share what's on your heart and your
mind, you speak to God. The St. Cyprian

185
00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:15.370
is another example. St. Cyprian says
earnestly practice lectio divina, which

186
00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:20.260
is the taking up of Scripture. Because
when you pray, you speak to God, and

187
00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.380
when you hear Him in His Word, he
speaks to you.

188
00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:29.950
So God is speaking to us, in His Word
in the Scriptures, that becomes the

189
00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:33.610
key. We don't have to have a mystic
gene. We don't have to be a prophet

190
00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.450
like Jonah.

191
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.600
Or a saint like St. Francis. That's the
unusual way but even in their lives,

192
00:14:40.690 --> 00:14:46.030
God primarily speaks to the prophets
and to the saints through His Word, as

193
00:14:46.030 --> 00:14:49.930
we're going to see. And so the
scriptures become the way God speaks to

194
00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:56.290
us. So we have to take and read, take
and read the scriptures. That's going

195
00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.920
to be one of the rallying cries of St.
Augustine. We'll see it in

196
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:04.850
St. Augustine's conversion. In book 8
of his Confessions, he talks about that

197
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:09.110
turning point in his life. And he was
at a friend's little villa. And he was

198
00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:12.560
in the courtyard, in the back
courtyard, which is like a garden. And

199
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.690
in that garden, he's distressed because
he heard the story of St. Anthony of

200
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:22.100
the Desert and how he followed Jesus
and St. Anthony as his parents die and

201
00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.970
he gets this great inheritance this
incredible fortune of wealth. He

202
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:29.360
wonders, what should I do with it? So
he goes to the church. And as he enters

203
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:35.870
the church, the reading for mass is the
story of the rich young man. And Jesus

204
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.940
says to the rich young man, go, sell
all that you have, and come and follow

205
00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:46.940
me. And Anthony hears that not as a
word of Jesus spoken to the rich young

206
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.930
man in the first century, but as the
Word of God that's living and active,

207
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:56.000
spoken to him at that moment. And
Anthony follows that advice.

208
00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.640
And that will change his life.

209
00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.460
And it will change his world. As he
begins this movement of monasticism.

210
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.900
This going out into the living in the
desert, totally dedicated to God. And

211
00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:12.380
Augustine hears these stories and a
couple others, and he's moved by them

212
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.940
he's like, Why can't I make that jump
that plunge, and he's been struggling,

213
00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.390
so it goes out in that little garden,
and he begins to almost break down, he

214
00:16:20.390 --> 00:16:26.660
starts to weep, because he's torn. He's
torn, because he knows his life living

215
00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.370
in the world is unhappy and miserable,
but he's afraid of the cost of

216
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:37.070
discipleship. He's afraid that
following God will cost him dearly.

217
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.950
And he's not sure if that is the right
way or not, and he's not sure what to

218
00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:46.420
do. And as he goes on to that garden,
he starts weeping. In the quiet of that

219
00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:51.820
night, he hears a child's voice over
the walls outside, and this child is

220
00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:57.580
singing his song, and the song is tolle
lege, tolle lege, tolle lege, which in

221
00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:05.440
Latin means, take and read, take and
read. So what does he do? He takes the

222
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.110
Bible. And he opens up to Romans 13.

223
00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:13.660
And in the midst of Romans 13, verse 11
and following he hears St. Paul say to

224
00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:20.380
the Romans, the night is far spent, put
away the deeds of the flesh. May no

225
00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:23.860
longer make provisions for the flesh.
And remember what Augustine had just

226
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:28.750
said earlier, right before this point,
he recounted his earlier prayer, God

227
00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:30.850
give me chastity, but not yet.

228
00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:37.530
Right, he was making all kinds of
provisions for the flesh, which is why

229
00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.920
it was hard to make this jump into
really following Christ.

230
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.530
And so he hears the word of God say, no
longer make any provisions for the

231
00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:47.130
flesh,

232
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:53.280
and put off the deeds of darkness, and
put on the deeds of Christ, the light

233
00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.590
of Christ, and walk in the light.

234
00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.540
And he hears that as a word spoken by
God to him.

235
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.370
And it changes his life. He acts on
that word.

236
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:12.770
So, we, like Augustine are invited to
hear God's word. But the challenge for

237
00:18:12.770 --> 00:18:19.010
us as we pick up the scriptures, is
that we are tempted to think that this

238
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:23.750
is a word spoken to other people in
another time and age. And we know

239
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.830
historically, they are words spoken to
different people at different times.

240
00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.620
It's a word of God spoken to Abraham,
or to Moses, or to David, or to Peter,

241
00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:35.150
or to Mary.

242
00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:42.330
But the secret of the saints is that
they hear the word of God afresh and

243
00:18:42.330 --> 00:18:47.640
living, and in the present. They hear
it as God's speaking now to them.

244
00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:53.280
And so the temptation that we have to
overcome is to pick up the scriptures

245
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:57.990
and hear it as a word spoken to
somebody else, such that we just become

246
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.460
eavesdroppers so to speak. We're just
listening in on somebody else's

247
00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.480
conversation. We're watching another
dialogue. But we don't enter the

248
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:07.080
dialogue.

249
00:19:08.790 --> 00:19:11.850
We study it, but we don't encounter it.

250
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:18.500
We can study God's Word in the
Scriptures, as many scholars have, but

251
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.940
never encounter that Word.

252
00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:24.280
And it was the great philosopher of the
20th century, the great philosopher of

253
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.810
language, Ludwig Wittgenstein who at
the end of one of his great treatises,

254
00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:35.890
said, You can't hear a God if someone
else is being addressed.

255
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:42.220
You can't hear God if someone else is
being addressed.

256
00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:48.370
In other words, Anthony wouldn't have
heard God speak to him if he would have

257
00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:52.570
said hmm, that's interesting and
curious how God spoke to that rich

258
00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:53.950
young man in the first century.

259
00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:00.520
That Jewish guy; that's kind of
curious. And Augustine

260
00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:05.280
could have said, Well, that was Paul's
address to the Christians in Rome in

261
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:11.220
the mid 50s. AD. I wonder what they
were doing back then? That's curious.

262
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:18.690
Right, no. What Anthony and Augustine,
and what every saint does, is they

263
00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:21.720
listen to God's Word, and they have an
ability to hear it.

264
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.070
Because they hear it as a word spoken

265
00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:33.480
to them. That's the secret of the
saints. And that's what Christ wants,

266
00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:38.220
and his encounter with us in His Word.
And so we're gonna see then, that

267
00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:41.190
there's simply two simple ingredients
prayer,

268
00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:43.860
two things necessary

269
00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:52.380
for prayer, to start us off, and that
is, we come and we listen first to God

270
00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:56.130
speak to us in his scriptures. We take
and read,

271
00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:03.630
as Augustine would say, stealing from
his mentor, St. Ambrose, when you pray,

272
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:07.260
you share what's on your heart and mind
with God, you speak to God. And when

273
00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:10.080
you open the scriptures, God speaks
back to you.

274
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.510
And it takes two

275
00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:19.290
to tango, it takes two to have a
dialogue. And if we make prayer a

276
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:23.550
dynamic dialogue, it becomes
interesting and engaging.

277
00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:31.320
If we reduce prayer, on the other hand
to a monologue, it becomes tedious and

278
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:37.140
tiresome and boring. So for example, if
you know somebody who likes to talk a

279
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:41.850
lot, and they take up time of
possession, I have a friend who, whose

280
00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:45.780
wife gave him as a teasing joke, a
t-shirt that said, help me I can't shut

281
00:21:45.780 --> 00:21:46.110
up.

282
00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.140
Right? That was a bit of a clue.
Sometimes men are a little clueless. We

283
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.160
don't put two and two together. But
that idea is, you know, sometimes if

284
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.800
someone calls you and you see the
caller id, and your like oh, my gosh,

285
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.520
if I answer that, it'll take me 30
minutes to get off if I start from the

286
00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:06.720
first minute to try to get off. So
we're afraid to take the call, right?

287
00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:12.900
Well, that's how prayer oftentimes is.
The reason that that person is so

288
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:18.540
tedious to talk to, is because it's a
monologue. It's a one way street, you

289
00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:23.400
can't get a word in edgewise. They just
talk and talk and talk. What makes

290
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.560
conversation interesting and engaging
is when it's a dynamic dialogue. Right?

291
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:31.320
When there's an interchange, someone
shares something, share something back

292
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:34.440
and you're laughing, you're going back
and forth. And it's interesting, it's

293
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:38.130
engaging, it's dynamic, because it's a
dialogue.

294
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:39.660
Right?

295
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:43.170
Well, I believe that prayer

296
00:22:44.490 --> 00:22:50.670
has a challenge for us, and that we see
prayer as a monologue. And therefore we

297
00:22:50.670 --> 00:22:57.300
see it as monotonous and tiresome and
boring and dull. And so any excuse to

298
00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:58.890
not pray is welcome.

299
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:05.010
Instead, however, if we encounter
prayer, as a dialogue,

300
00:23:06.330 --> 00:23:09.780
we would find that it's far more
engaging than we ever imagined. It's

301
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:15.780
far more interesting. What is prayer?
Prayer is a dialogue with God.

302
00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:22.590
It's a conversation with God, it's an
encounter with God. But it's an

303
00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:23.820
encounter with the other.

304
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:31.760
With us, it's a relationship. It's the
I-Thou, it's this dialogue. And if we

305
00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:34.160
reduce prayer to ourselves alone,

306
00:23:35.230 --> 00:23:41.380
in solitude, we lose the beauty of
prayer. We lose the relational idea of

307
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:46.150
prayer. Now, the Catechism of the
Catholic Church talks about prayer as

308
00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:50.290
an encounter as a dialogue. And it sets
up at the very beginning of its

309
00:23:50.290 --> 00:23:56.110
teaching on prayer, the beautiful scene
of the Samaritan woman at the well, in

310
00:23:56.110 --> 00:24:03.100
John chapter 4, where Jesus comes to
the well, and Jesus thirsts. And I want

311
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:07.030
to talk about that scene. I want to
read what the Catechism has to say

312
00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:12.130
about that. And as I do that, I want
you to look at this beautiful icon here

313
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:17.260
of Jesus with the Samaritan woman. This
was this icon was painted by the priest

314
00:24:17.260 --> 00:24:22.840
who has said mass for over 40 years in
the Holy Land at Jacob's Well. Father

315
00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.580
Justinian built the church there.

316
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:31.120
And he built that church over it, and
he did this icon. He's a great famous

317
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:36.370
iconographer. Fr. Justinian's from
Greece. And he grew up trained in the

318
00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:41.110
iconic tradition. And so he shows Jesus
sitting at the well and the Samaritan

319
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.410
woman, and he had the Samaritan woman
with the jug, because Jesus has nothing

320
00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:48.580
to draw water from from the well. And
Jesus comes to well because he thirsts,

321
00:24:48.790 --> 00:24:54.520
and the Catechism says that prayer,
ironically and paradoxically, is first

322
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:56.350
God's thirst for you.

323
00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:00.550
God searches and longs for us

324
00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:05.800
to seek Him and to encounter him. We
think that it's, prayer is man's search

325
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.840
for God. And the Catechism says, we get
it backwards. God's the initiator,

326
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:14.560
God's the starting point. And so I want
to give us a couple little quotes from

327
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:19.690
this, this paragraph to end with, to
show us that prayer is that encounter

328
00:25:19.690 --> 00:25:25.000
that becomes a dialogue. So in
paragraph 2560, of the Catechism says,

329
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:30.190
The wonder of prayer is revealed beside
the well,

330
00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:33.100
where we come seeking water.

331
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:38.140
There Christ comes to meet every human
being.

332
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:50.290
It is he who first seeks us and asks us
for a drink. Jesus thirsts. His asking

333
00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:54.250
arises from the depths of God's desire
for us.

334
00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:57.780
That's an extraordinary statement.

335
00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.240
God thirsts. It was one of the greatest
saints of the 20th century Mother

336
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:07.320
Teresa of Calcutta, who put that
phrase, I thirst that Jesus speaks on

337
00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:12.210
the cross. And she put it next to every
crucifix in every one of the

338
00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.650
Missionaries of Charity chapels. So
that every sister and every person

339
00:26:16.650 --> 00:26:21.570
would come in, every volunteer, every
poor person, every sick person, in one

340
00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:25.680
of those places would come and the
first thing that they would hear is a

341
00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.860
word from Christ, I thirst.

342
00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:36.210
And what Jesus revealed to Mother is
that he thirsts for us, he thirsts for

343
00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.020
our love.

344
00:26:38.190 --> 00:26:44.970
God seeks us out. This is the
extraordinary good news. God's not just

345
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.990
simply a passive DVD saying, prayer
would be good for you like flossing,

346
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:50.910
and it's something you ought to do.

347
00:26:50.000 --> 00:27:01.490
And so do it. Now. God is love. And to
love is to thirst for love. If you love

348
00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:07.310
you long for the beloved, and because
God in His very being is love, God and

349
00:27:07.310 --> 00:27:13.880
His very being hungers and thirsts and
desires your heart and your love.

350
00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:19.910
That's the first lesson of prayer that
our Holy Mother Church teaches us in

351
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:24.980
the Catechism. And we are invited to
come to that well, and encounter God's

352
00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:29.300
thirst. Now how we do that is what
we're going to take up in the next

353
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:30.260
several episodes.
